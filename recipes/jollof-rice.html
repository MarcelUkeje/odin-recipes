<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Nigerian Jollof Rice is a beloved West African one-pot dish known for its vibrant color, smoky aroma, and rich, savory taste. It features long-grain rice cooked in a deeply flavored tomato-and-pepper base, seasoned with a blend of spices and aromatics like thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, garlic, and ginger. Often enjoyed at celebrations and family gatherings, Jollof Rice is both comforting and festive, pairing beautifully with fried plantains, grilled meats, or a fresh side salad.

This recipe guides you through creating an authentic pot of Nigerian Jollof Rice, from preparing the perfect tomato stew to achieving that sought-after slightly toasted bottom known as “party rice.” Whether you’re new to African cooking or a seasoned home chef, this step-by-step approach ensures tender, flavorful rice every time.

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups long-grain parboiled rice, rinsed until water runs clear</li>

    <li>4 large tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
    
    <li>2 red bell peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
    
    <li>2–3 red Scotch bonnet or habanero peppers (adjust for heat), stemmed</li>
    
    <li>1 large red onion, quartered</li>
    
    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
    
    <li>1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled</li>
    
    <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
    
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    
    <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
    
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    
    <li>1 chicken or vegetable bouillon cube</li>
    
    <li>3–4 cups chicken stock (or water)</li>
    
    <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>


<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Blend the base: In a blender, combine tomatoes, bell peppers, Scotch bonnets, onion, garlic, and ginger. Blend until smooth and set aside.</li>

    <li>Cook the stew: Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Stir in the tomato paste and fry for 2–3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the paste darkens slightly. Add the blended mixture and cook for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce reduces and the oil separates on top.</li>
    
    <li>Season: Stir in thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, and crumbled bouillon cube. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Add rice and stock: Pour in the rinsed rice and stir to coat every grain with the sauce. Add enough chicken stock (about 3 cups) to just cover the rice—there should be about a half-inch of liquid above the rice. Bring to a gentle boil.</li>
    
    <li>Simmer: Reduce heat to low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and let simmer undisturbed for 20–25 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed. For a “party rice” effect, uncover for the last 5 minutes to allow the bottom layer to toast lightly.</li>
    
    <li>Rest and fluff: Remove from heat and let the rice rest, covered, for 5–10 minutes. Fluff gently with a fork before serving.</li>
</ol>

Serving Suggestions
Pair with fried plantains, grilled chicken, or suya (spiced beef skewers).

A simple cabbage-and-carrot slaw or sliced cucumbers balances the heat.

Garnish with fresh parsley or green onions for a pop of color.
